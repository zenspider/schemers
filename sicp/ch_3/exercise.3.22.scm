;;; Exercise 3.22

;; Instead of representing a queue as a pair of
;; pointers, we can build a queue as a procedure with local state.
;; The local state will consist of pointers to the beginning and the
;; end of an ordinary list.  Thus, the `make-queue' procedure will
;; have the form
;;
;;      (define (make-queue)
;;        (let ((front-ptr ... )
;;              (rear-ptr ... ))
;;          <DEFINITIONS OF INTERNAL PROCEDURES>
;;          (define (dispatch m) ...)
;;          dispatch))
;;
;; Complete the definition of `make-queue' and provide
;; implementations of the queue operations using this representation.
