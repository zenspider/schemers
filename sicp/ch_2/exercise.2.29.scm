;; Exercise 2.29.  

;; A binary mobile consists of two branches, a left branch and a right branch. 
;; Each branch is a rod of a certain length, from which hangs either a weight 
;; or another binary mobile. We can represent a binary mobile using compound 
;; data by constructing it from two branches (for example, using list):
;;
;; (define (make-mobile left right)
;;   (list left right))
;;
;; A branch is constructed from a length (which must be a number) together with a 
;; structure, which may be either a number (representing a simple weight) or 
;; another mobile:
;;
;; (define (make-branch length structure)
;;  (list length structure))
;;
;; a.  Write the corresponding selectors left-branch and right-branch, which 
;; return the branches of a mobile, and branch-length and branch-structure, 
;; which return the components of a branch.
;;
;; b.  Using your selectors, define a procedure total-weight that returns the 
;; total weight of a mobile.
;;
;; c.  A mobile is said to be balanced if the torque applied by its top-left 
;; branch is equal to that applied by its top-right branch (that is, if the 
;; length of the left rod multiplied by the weight hanging from that rod is 
;; equal to the corresponding product for the right side) and if each of the 
;; submobiles hanging off its branches is balanced. Design a predicate that 
;; tests whether a binary mobile is balanced.

;; d.  Suppose we change the representation of mobiles so that the constructors 
;; are

;; (define (make-mobile left right)
;;   (cons left right))
;; (define (make-branch length structure)
;;   (cons length structure))

;; How much do you need to change your programs to convert to the new 
;; representation?
