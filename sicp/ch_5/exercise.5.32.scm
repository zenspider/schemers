;;; Exercise 5.32

;; Using the `preserving' mechanism, the compiler
;; will avoid saving and restoring `env' around the evaluation of the
;; operator of a combination in the case where the operator is a
;; symbol.  We could also build such optimizations into the
;; evaluator.  Indeed, the explicit-control evaluator of section
;; *Note 5-4:: already performs a similar optimization, by treating
;; combinations with no operands as a special case.
;;
;;   a. Extend the explicit-control evaluator to recognize as a
;;      separate class of expressions combinations whose operator is
;;      a symbol, and to take advantage of this fact in evaluating
;;      such expressions.
;;
;;   b. Alyssa P. Hacker suggests that by extending the evaluator to
;;      recognize more and more special cases we could incorporate
;;      all the compiler's optimizations, and that this would
;;      eliminate the advantage of compilation altogether.  What do
;;      you think of this idea?
