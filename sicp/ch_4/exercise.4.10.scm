;;; Exercise 4.10

;; By using data abstraction, we were able to write
;; an `eval' procedure that is independent of the particular syntax
;; of the language to be evaluated.  To illustrate this, design and
;; implement a new syntax for Scheme by modifying the procedures in
;; this section, without changing `eval' or `apply'.

;; We've done this throughout the whole chapter. What's the point?
