;;; Exercise 2.70:

;; The following eight-symbol alphabet with associated relative
;; frequencies was designed to efficiently encode the lyrics of 1950s
;; rock songs. (Note that the "symbols" of an "alphabet" need not be
;; individual letters.)
;;
;;      A     2 NA   16
;;      BOOM  1 SHA  3
;;      GET   2 YIP  9
;;      JOB   2 WAH  1
;;
;; Use `generate-huffman-tree' (*Note Exercise 2-69::) to generate a
;; corresponding Huffman tree, and use `encode' (*Note Exercise
;; 2-68::) to encode the following message:
;;
;;      Get a job
;;
;;      Sha na na na na na na na na
;;
;;      Get a job
;;
;;      Sha na na na na na na na na
;;
;;      Wah yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip
;;
;;      Sha boom
;;
;; How many bits are required for the encoding?  What is the smallest
;; number of bits that would be needed to encode this song if we used
;; a fixed-length code for the eight-symbol alphabet?
