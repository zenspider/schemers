;;; Exercise 2.69:

;; The following procedure takes as its argument a list of
;; symbol-frequency pairs (where no symbol appears in more than one
;; pair) and generates a Huffman encoding tree according to the
;; Huffman algorithm.
;;
;;      (define (generate-huffman-tree pairs)
;;        (successive-merge (make-leaf-set pairs)))
;;
;; `Make-leaf-set' is the procedure given above that transforms the
;; list of pairs into an ordered set of leaves.  `Successive-merge'
;; is the procedure you must write, using `make-code-tree' to
;; successively merge the smallest-weight elements of the set until
;; there is only one element left, which is the desired Huffman tree.
;; (This procedure is slightly tricky, but not really complicated.
;; If you find yourself designing a complex procedure, then you are
;; almost certainly doing something wrong.  You can take significant
;; advantage of the fact that we are using an ordered set
;; representation.)
