;; Exercise 2.33

;; Fill in the missing expressions to complete the following
;; definitions of some basic list-manipulation operations as
;; accumulations:
;;
;;      (define (map p sequence)
;;        (accumulate (lambda (x y) <??>) nil sequence))
;;
;;      (define (append seq1 seq2)
;;        (accumulate cons <??> <??>))
;;
;;      (define (length sequence)
;;        (accumulate <??> 0 sequence))
