;;; Exercise 2.84

;; Using the `raise' operation of *Note Exercise
;; 2-83::, modify the `apply-generic' procedure so that it coerces
;; its arguments to have the same type by the method of successive
;; raising, as discussed in this section.  You will need to devise a
;; way to test which of two types is higher in the tower.  Do this in
;; a manner that is "compatible" with the rest of the system and will
;; not lead to problems in adding new levels to the tower.
