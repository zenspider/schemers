;;; Exercise 3.34

;; Louis Reasoner wants to build a squarer, a
;; constraint device with two terminals such that the value of
;; connector `b' on the second terminal will always be the square of
;; the value `a' on the first terminal.  He proposes the following
;; simple device made from a multiplier:
;;
;;      (define (squarer a b)
;;        (multiplier a a b))
;;
;; There is a serious flaw in this idea.  Explain.

;; (assert-equal x y)
