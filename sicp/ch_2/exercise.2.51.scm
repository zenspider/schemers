;; Exercise 2.51

;; Define the `below' operation for painters. `Below' takes two
;; painters as arguments. The resulting painter, given a frame, draws
;; with the first painter in the bottom of the frame and with the
;; second painter in the top. Define `below' in two different
;; ways--first by writing a procedure that is analogous to the
;; `beside' procedure given above, and again in terms of `beside' and
;; suitable rotation operations (from *Note Exercise 2-50::).
