;;; Exercise 1.33:

;; You can obtain an even more general version of `accumulate'
;; (*Note
Exercise 1-32) by introducing the notion of a "filter" on the
;; terms to be combined. That is, combine only those terms derived
;; from values in the range that satisfy a specified condition. The
;; resulting `filtered-accumulate' abstraction takes the same
;; arguments as accumulate, together with an additional predicate of
;; one argument that specifies the filter. Write `filtered-accumulate'
;; as a procedure. Show how to express the following using
;; `filtered-accumulate':
;; 
;;   a. the sum of the squares of the prime numbers in the interval a
;;      to b (assuming that you have a `prime?' predicate already
;;      written)
;; 
;;   b. the product of all the positive integers less than n that are
;;      relatively prime to n (i.e., all positive integers i < n such
;;      that GCD(i,n) = 1).
