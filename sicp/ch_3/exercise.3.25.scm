;; Generalizing one- and two-dimensional tables,
;; show how to implement a table in which values are stored under an
;; arbitrary number of keys and different values may be stored under
;; different numbers of keys.  The `lookup' and `insert!' procedures
;; should take as input a list of keys used to access the table.
