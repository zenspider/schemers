;;; Exercise 2.76

;; As a large system with generic operations
;; evolves, new types of data objects or new operations may be needed.
;; For each of the three strategies--generic operations with explicit
;; dispatch, data-directed style, and message-passing-style--describe
;; the changes that must be made to a system in order to add new
;; types or new operations.  Which organization would be most
;; appropriate for a system in which new types must often be added?
;; Which would be most appropriate for a system in which new
;; operations must often be added?
