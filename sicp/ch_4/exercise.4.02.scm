;;; Exercise 4.2

;; Louis Reasoner plans to reorder the `cond' clauses
;; in `eval' so that the clause for procedure applications appears
;; before the clause for assignments.  He argues that this will make
;; the interpreter more efficient: Since programs usually contain more
;; applications than assignments, definitions, and so on, his
;; modified `eval' will usually check fewer clauses than the original
;; `eval' before identifying the type of an expression.
;;
;;   a. What is wrong with Louis's plan?  (Hint: What will Louis's
;;      evaluator do with the expression `(define x 3)'?)

;; A: Besides the fact that he's an idiot? (application? exp) is
;; defined as (pair? exp), which is true of definitions, so he'd break
;; everything.

;;   b. Louis is upset that his plan didn't work.  He is willing to
;;      go to any lengths to make his evaluator recognize procedure
;;      applications before it checks for most other kinds of
;;      expressions.  Help him by changing the syntax of the
;;      evaluated language so that procedure applications start with
;;      `call'.  For example, instead of `(factorial 3)' we will now
;;      have to write `(call factorial 3)' and instead of `(+ 1 2)'
;;      we will have to write `(call + 1 2)'.

;; you only have to change the following:

(define (application? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'call))
(define operator cadr)
(define operands cddr)
