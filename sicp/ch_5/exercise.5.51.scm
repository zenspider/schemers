;;; Exercise 5.51

;; Develop a rudimentary implementation of Scheme in C (or some other
;; low-level language of your choice) by translating the
;; explicit-control evaluator of section *Note 5-4:: into C. In order
;; to run this code you will need to also provide appropriate
;; storage-allocation routines and other run-time support.
