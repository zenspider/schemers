;;; Exercise 4.75

;; Implement for the query language a new special
;; form called `unique'.  `Unique' should succeed if there is
;; precisely one item in the data base satisfying a specified query.
;; For example,
;;
;;      (unique (job ?x (computer wizard)))
;;
;; should print the one-item stream
;;
;;      (unique (job (Bitdiddle Ben) (computer wizard)))
;;
;; since Ben is the only computer wizard, and
;;
;;      (unique (job ?x (computer programmer)))
;;
;; should print the empty stream, since there is more than one
;; computer programmer.  Moreover,
;;
;;      (and (job ?x ?j) (unique (job ?anyone ?j)))
;;
;; should list all the jobs that are filled by only one person, and
;; the people who fill them.
;;
;; There are two parts to implementing `unique'.  The first is to
;; write a procedure that handles this special form, and the second
;; is to make `qeval' dispatch to that procedure.  The second part is
;; trivial, since `qeval' does its dispatching in a data-directed
;; way.  If your procedure is called `uniquely-asserted', all you
;; need to do is
;;
;;      (put 'unique 'qeval uniquely-asserted)
;;
;; and `qeval' will dispatch to this procedure for every query whose
;; `type' (`car') is the symbol `unique'.
;;
;; The real problem is to write the procedure `uniquely-asserted'.
;; This should take as input the `contents' (`cdr') of the `unique'
;; query, together with a stream of frames.  For each frame in the
;; stream, it should use `qeval' to find the stream of all extensions
;; to the frame that satisfy the given query.  Any stream that does
;; not have exactly one item in it should be eliminated.  The
;; remaining streams should be passed back to be accumulated into one
;; big stream that is the result of the `unique' query.  This is
;; similar to the implementation of the `not' special form.
;;
;; Test your implementation by forming a query that lists all people
;; who supervise precisely one person.
