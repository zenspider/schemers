;;; Exercise 2.73

;; Section *Note 2-3-2:: described a program that
;; performs symbolic differentiation:
;;
;;      (define (deriv exp var)
;;        (cond ((number? exp) 0)
;;              ((variable? exp) (if (same-variable? exp var) 1 0))
;;              ((sum? exp)
;;               (make-sum (deriv (addend exp) var)
;;                         (deriv (augend exp) var)))
;;              ((product? exp)
;;               (make-sum
;;                 (make-product (multiplier exp)
;;                               (deriv (multiplicand exp) var))
;;                 (make-product (deriv (multiplier exp) var)
;;                               (multiplicand exp))))
;;              <MORE RULES CAN BE ADDED HERE>
;;              (else (error "unknown expression type -- DERIV" exp))))
;;
;; We can regard this program as performing a dispatch on the type of
;; the expression to be differentiated.  In this situation the "type
;; tag" of the datum is the algebraic operator symbol (such as `+')
;; and the operation being performed is `deriv'.  We can transform
;; this program into data-directed style by rewriting the basic
;; derivative procedure as
;;
;;      (define (deriv exp var)
;;         (cond ((number? exp) 0)
;;               ((variable? exp) (if (same-variable? exp var) 1 0))
;;               (else ((get 'deriv (operator exp)) (operands exp)
;;                                                  var))))
;;
;;      (define (operator exp) (car exp))
;;
;;      (define (operands exp) (cdr exp))
;;
;;   a. Explain what was done above.  Why can't we assimilate the
;;      predicates `number?' and `same-variable?' into the
;;      data-directed dispatch?
;;
;;   b. Write the procedures for derivatives of sums and products,
;;      and the auxiliary code required to install them in the table
;;      used by the program above.
;;
;;   c. Choose any additional differentiation rule that you like,
;;      such as the one for exponents (*Note Exercise 2-56::), and
;;      install it in this data-directed system.
;;
;;   d. In this simple algebraic manipulator the type of an
;;      expression is the algebraic operator that binds it together.
;;      Suppose, however, we indexed the procedures in the opposite
;;      way, so that the dispatch line in `deriv' looked like
;;
;;           ((get (operator exp) 'deriv) (operands exp) var)
;;
;;      What corresponding changes to the derivative system are
;;      required?
