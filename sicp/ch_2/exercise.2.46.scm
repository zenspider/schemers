;; Exercise 2.46

;; A two-dimensional vector v running from the origin to a point can
;; be represented as a pair consisting of an x-coordinate and a
;; y-coordinate. Implement a data abstraction for vectors by giving a
;; constructor `make-vect' and corresponding selectors `xcor-vect' and
;; `ycor-vect'. In terms of your selectors and constructor, implement
;; procedures `add-vect', `sub-vect', and `scale-vect' that perform
;; the operations vector addition, vector subtraction, and multiplying
;; a vector by a scalar:
;;
;;      (x_1, y_1) + (x_2, y_2) = (x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2)
;;      (x_1, y_1) - (x_2, y_2) = (x_1 - x_2, y_1 - y_2)
;;                   s * (x, y) = (sx, sy)

;; (assert-equal x y)
(done)
