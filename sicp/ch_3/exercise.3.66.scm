;;; Exercise 3.66

;; Examine the stream `(pairs integers integers)'.
;; Can you make any general comments about the order in which the
;; pairs are placed into the stream? For example, about how many
;; pairs precede the pair (1,100)?  the pair (99,100)? the pair
;; (100,100)? (If you can make precise mathematical statements here,
;; all the better. But feel free to give more qualitative answers if
;; you find yourself getting bogged down.)
