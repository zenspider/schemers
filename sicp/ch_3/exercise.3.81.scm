;;; Exercise 3.81

;; *Note Exercise 3-6:: discussed generalizing the
;; random-number generator to allow one to reset the random-number
;; sequence so as to produce repeatable sequences of "random"
;; numbers.  Produce a stream formulation of this same generator that
;; operates on an input stream of requests to `generate' a new random
;; number or to `reset' the sequence to a specified value and that
;; produces the desired stream of random numbers.  Don't use
;; assignment in your solution.
