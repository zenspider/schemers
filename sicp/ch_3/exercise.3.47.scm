;;; Exercise 3.47

;; A semaphore (of size n) is a generalization of a
;; mutex.  Like a mutex, a semaphore supports acquire and release
;; operations, but it is more general in that up to n processes can
;; acquire it concurrently.  Additional processes that attempt to
;; acquire the semaphore must wait for release operations.  Give
;; implementations of semaphores
;;
;;   a. in terms of mutexes
;;
;;   b. in terms of atomic `test-and-set!' operations.
