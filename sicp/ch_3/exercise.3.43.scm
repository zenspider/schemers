;;; Exercise 3.43

;; Suppose that the balances in three accounts start out as $10, $20,
;; and $30, and that multiple processes run, exchanging the balances
;; in the accounts. Argue that if the processes are run sequentially,
;; after any number of concurrent exchanges, the account balances
;; should be $10, $20, and $30 in some order. Draw a timing diagram
;; like the one in *Note Figure 3-29:: to show how this condition can
;; be violated if the exchanges are implemented using the first
;; version of the account-exchange program in this section. On the
;; other hand, argue that even with this `exchange' program, the sum
;; of the balances in the accounts will be preserved. Draw a timing
;; diagram to show how even this condition would be violated if we did
;; not serialize the transactions on individual accounts.

;; no
