;;; Exercise 1.25:

;; Alyssa P. Hacker complains that we went to a lot of extra work in
;; writing `expmod'. After all, she says, since we already know how to
;; compute exponentials, we could have simply written

(define (expmod base exp m)
  (remainder (fast-expt base exp) m))

;; Is she correct? Would this procedure serve as well for our fast
;; prime tester? Explain.
