;;; Exercise 5.47

;; This section described how to modify the explicit-control evaluator
;; so that interpreted code can call compiled procedures. Show how to
;; modify the compiler so that compiled procedures can call not only
;; primitive procedures and compiled procedures, but interpreted
;; procedures as well. This requires modifying
;; `compile-procedure-call' to handle the case of compound
;; (interpreted) procedures. Be sure to handle all the same `target'
;; and `linkage' combinations as in `compile-proc-appl'. To do the
;; actual procedure application, the code needs to jump to the
;; evaluator's `compound-apply' entry point. This label cannot be
;; directly referenced in object code (since the assembler requires
;; that all labels referenced by the code it is assembling be defined
;; there), so we will add a register called `compapp' to the evaluator
;; machine to hold this entry point, and add an instruction to
;; initialize it:
;;
;;      (assign compapp (label compound-apply))
;;        (branch (label external-entry))      ; branches if `flag' is set
;;      read-eval-print-loop
;;        ...
;;
;; To test your code, start by defining a procedure `f' that calls a
;; procedure `g'. Use `compile-and-go' to compile the definition of
;; `f' and start the evaluator. Now, typing at the evaluator, define
;; `g' and try to call `f'.
