;;; Exercise 5.31

;; In evaluating a procedure application, the
;; explicit-control evaluator always saves and restores the `env'
;; register around the evaluation of the operator, saves and restores
;; `env' around the evaluation of each operand (except the final
;; one), saves and restores `argl' around the evaluation of each
;; operand, and saves and restores `proc' around the evaluation of
;; the operand sequence.  For each of the following combinations, say
;; which of these `save' and `restore' operations are superfluous and
;; thus could be eliminated by the compiler's `preserving' mechanism:
;;
;;      (f 'x 'y)
;;
;;      ((f) 'x 'y)
;;
;;      (f (g 'x) y)
;;
;;      (f (g 'x) 'y)
