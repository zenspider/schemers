;;; Exercise 1.29:

;; Simpson's Rule is a more accurate method of numerical integration
;; than the method illustrated above. Using Simpson's Rule, the
;; integral of a function f between a and b is approximated as
;; 
;;      h
;;      - (y_0 + 4y_1 + 2y_2 + 4y_3 + 2y_4 + ... + 2y_(n-2) + 4y_(n-1) + y_n)
;;      3
;; 
;; where h = (b - a)/n, for some even integer n, and y_k = f(a + kh).
;; (Increasing n increases the accuracy of the approximation.) Define
;; a procedure that takes as arguments f, a, b, and n and returns the
;; value of the integral, computed using Simpson's Rule. Use your
;; procedure to integrate `cube' between 0 and 1 (with n = 100 and n =
;; 1000), and compare the results to those of the `integral' procedure
;; shown above.
