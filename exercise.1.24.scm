;;; Exercise 1.24:

;; Modify the `timed-prime-test' procedure of *Note Exercise 1-22:: to
;; use `fast-prime?' (the Fermat method), and test each of the 12
;; primes you found in that exercise. Since the Fermat test has
;; [theta](`log' n) growth, how would you expect the time to test
;; primes near 1,000,000 to compare with the time needed to test
;; primes near 1000? Do your data bear this out? Can you explain any
;; discrepancy you find?
