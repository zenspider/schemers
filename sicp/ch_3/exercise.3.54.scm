;;; Exercise 3.54

;; Define a procedure `mul-streams', analogous to
;; `add-streams', that produces the elementwise product of its two
;; input streams.  Use this together with the stream of `integers' to
;; complete the following definition of the stream whose nth element
;; (counting from 0) is n + 1 factorial:
;;
;;      (define factorials (cons-stream 1 (mul-streams <??> <??>)))

;; (assert-equal x y)
