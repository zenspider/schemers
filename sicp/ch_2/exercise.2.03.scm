;;; Exercise 2.3:

;; Implement a representation for rectangles in a plane. (Hint: You
;; may want to make use of *Note Exercise 2-2::.) In terms of your
;; constructors and selectors, create procedures that compute the
;; perimeter and the area of a given rectangle. Now implement a
;; different representation for rectangles. Can you design your system
;; with suitable abstraction barriers, so that the same perimeter and
;; area procedures will work using either representation?
