;;; Exercise 5.46

;; Carry out an analysis like the one in *Note
;; Exercise 5-45:: to determine the effectiveness of compiling the
;; tree-recursive Fibonacci procedure
;;
;;      (define (fib n)
;;        (if (< n 2)
;;            n
;;            (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))))
;;
;; compared to the effectiveness of using the special-purpose
;; Fibonacci machine of *Note Figure 5-12::.  (For measurement of the
;; interpreted performance, see *Note Exercise 5-29::.)  For
;; Fibonacci, the time resource used is not linear in n; hence the
;; ratios of stack operations will not approach a limiting value that
;; is independent of n.
