;;; Exercise 2.1:

;; Define a better version of `make-rat' that handles both positive
;; and negative arguments. `Make-rat' should normalize the sign so
;; that if the rational number is positive, both the numerator and
;; denominator are positive, and if the rational number is negative,
;; only the numerator is negative.
