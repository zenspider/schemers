;;; Exercise 3.27

;; "Memoization" (also called "tabulation") is a
;; technique that enables a procedure to record, in a local table,
;; values that have previously been computed.  This technique can
;; make a vast difference in the performance of a program.  A memoized
;; procedure maintains a table in which values of previous calls are
;; stored using as keys the arguments that produced the values.  When
;; the memoized procedure is asked to compute a value, it first
;; checks the table to see if the value is already there and, if so,
;; just returns that value.  Otherwise, it computes the new value in
;; the ordinary way and stores this in the table.  As an example of
;; memoization, recall from section *Note 1-2-2:: the exponential
;; process for computing Fibonacci numbers:
;;
;;      (define (fib n)
;;        (cond ((= n 0) 0)
;;              ((= n 1) 1)
;;              (else (+ (fib (- n 1))
;;                       (fib (- n 2))))))
;;
;; The memoized version of the same procedure is
;;
;;      (define memo-fib
;;        (memoize (lambda (n)
;;                   (cond ((= n 0) 0)
;;                         ((= n 1) 1)
;;                         (else (+ (memo-fib (- n 1))
;;                                  (memo-fib (- n 2))))))))
;;
;; where the memoizer is defined as
;;
;;      (define (memoize f)
;;        (let ((table (make-table)))
;;          (lambda (x)
;;            (let ((previously-computed-result (lookup x table)))
;;              (or previously-computed-result
;;                  (let ((result (f x)))
;;                    (insert! x result table)
;;                    result))))))
;;
;; Draw an environment diagram to analyze the computation of
;; `(memo-fib 3)'.  Explain why `memo-fib' computes the nth Fibonacci
;; number in a number of steps proportional to n.  Would the scheme
;; still work if we had simply defined `memo-fib' to be `(memoize
;; fib)'?
