;;; Exercise 1.32:

;;   a. Show that `sum' and `product' (*Note Exercise 1-31::) are both
;;      special cases of a still more general notion called
;;      `accumulate' that combines a collection of terms, using some
;;      general accumulation function:
;; 
;;           (accumulate combiner null-value term a next b)
;; 
;;      `Accumulate' takes as arguments the same term and range
;;      specifications as `sum' and `product', together with a
;;      `combiner' procedure (of two arguments) that specifies how the
;;      current term is to be combined with the accumulation of the
;;      preceding terms and a `null-value' that specifies what base
;;      value to use when the terms run out. Write `accumulate' and
;;      show how `sum' and `product' can both be defined as simple
;;      calls to `accumulate'.
;; 
;;   b. If your `accumulate' procedure generates a recursive process,
;;      write one that generates an iterative process. If it generates
;;      an iterative process, write one that generates a recursive
;;      process.
