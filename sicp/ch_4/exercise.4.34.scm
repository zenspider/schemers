;;; Exercise 4.34

;; Modify the driver loop for the evaluator so that
;; lazy pairs and lists will print in some reasonable way.  (What are
;; you going to do about infinite lists?)  You may also need to modify
;; the representation of lazy pairs so that the evaluator can
;; identify them in order to print them.
