;;; Exercise 4.42

;; Solve the following "Liars" puzzle (from Phillips
;; 1934):
;;
;; Five schoolgirls sat for an examination.  Their parents--so they
;; thought--showed an undue degree of interest in the result.  They
;; therefore agreed that, in writing home about the examination, each
;; girl should make one true statement and one untrue one.  The
;; following are the relevant passages from their letters:
;;
;;    * Betty: "Kitty was second in the examination.  I was only
;;      third."
;;
;;    * Ethel: "You'll be glad to hear that I was on top.  Joan was
;;      second."
;;
;;    * Joan: "I was third, and poor old Ethel was bottom."
;;
;;    * Kitty: "I came out second.  Mary was only fourth."
;;
;;    * Mary: "I was fourth.  Top place was taken by Betty."
;;
;;
;; What in fact was the order in which the five girls were placed?
