;;; *Exercise 1.8:*
;; Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y is an
;; approximation to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is
;; given by the value
;; 
;;      x/y^2 + 2y
;;      ----------
;;          3
;; 
;; Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to
;; the square-root procedure. (In section *Note 1-3-4:: we will see
;; how to implement Newton's method in general as an abstraction of
;; these square-root and cube-root procedures.)
