;;; Exercise 4.59

;; Ben Bitdiddle has missed one meeting too many.
;; Fearing that his habit of forgetting meetings could cost him his
;; job, Ben decides to do something about it.  He adds all the weekly
;; meetings of the firm to the Microshaft data base by asserting the
;; following:
;;
;;      (meeting accounting (Monday 9am))
;;      (meeting administration (Monday 10am))
;;      (meeting computer (Wednesday 3pm))
;;      (meeting administration (Friday 1pm))
;;
;; Each of the above assertions is for a meeting of an entire
;; division.  Ben also adds an entry for the company-wide meeting
;; that spans all the divisions.  All of the company's employees
;; attend this meeting.
;;
;;      (meeting whole-company (Wednesday 4pm))
;;
;;   a. On Friday morning, Ben wants to query the data base for all
;;      the meetings that occur that day.  What query should he use?
;;
;;   b. Alyssa P. Hacker is unimpressed.  She thinks it would be much
;;      more useful to be able to ask for her meetings by specifying
;;      her name.  So she designs a rule that says that a person's
;;      meetings include all `whole-company' meetings plus all
;;      meetings of that person's division.  Fill in the body of
;;      Alyssa's rule.
;;
;;           (rule (meeting-time ?person ?day-and-time)
;;                 <RULE-BODY>)
;;
;;   c. Alyssa arrives at work on Wednesday morning and wonders what
;;      meetings she has to attend that day.  Having defined the
;;      above rule, what query should she make to find this out?
