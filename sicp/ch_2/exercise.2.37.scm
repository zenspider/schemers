;; Exercise 2.37

;; Suppose we represent vectors v = (v_i) as sequences of numbers, and
;; matrices m = (m_(ij)) as sequences of vectors (the rows of the
;; matrix). For example, the matrix
;;
;;      +-         -+
;;      |  1 2 3 4  |
;;      |  4 5 6 6  |
;;      |  6 7 8 9  |
;;      +-         -+
;;
;; is represented as the sequence `((1 2 3 4) (4 5 6 6) (6 7 8 9))'.
;; With this representation, we can use sequence operations to
;; concisely express the basic matrix and vector operations. These
;; operations (which are described in any book on matrix algebra) are
;; the following:
;;
;;                                             __
;;      (dot-product v w)      returns the sum >_i v_i w_i
;;
;;      (matrix-*-vector m v)  returns the vector t,
;;                                         __
;;                             where t_i = >_j m_(ij) v_j
;;
;;      (matrix-*-matrix m n)  returns the matrix p,
;;                                            __
;;                             where p_(ij) = >_k m_(ik) n_(kj)
;;
;;      (transpose m)          returns the matrix n,
;;                             where n_(ij) = m_(ji)
;;
;;    We can define the dot product as(4)
;;
;;      (define (dot-product v w)
;;        (accumulate + 0 (map * v w)))
;;
;; Fill in the missing expressions in the following procedures for
;; computing the other matrix operations. (The procedure
;; `accumulate-n' is defined in *Note Exercise 2-36::.)
;;
;;      (define (matrix-*-vector m v)
;;        (map <??> m))
;;
;;      (define (transpose mat)
;;        (accumulate-n <??> <??> mat))
;;
;;      (define (matrix-*-matrix m n)
;;        (let ((cols (transpose n)))
;;          (map <??> m)))

;; (assert-equal x y)
