;;; Exercise 3.36

;; Suppose we evaluate the following sequence of
;; expressions in the global environment:

(define a (make-connector))
(define b (make-connector))
(set-value! a 10 'user)

;; At some time during evaluation of the `set-value!', the following
;; expression from the connector's local procedure is evaluated:
;;
;;      (for-each-except setter inform-about-value constraints)
;;
;; Draw an environment diagram showing the environment in which the
;; above expression is evaluated.

;; no
