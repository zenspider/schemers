;;; Exercise 2.90

;; Suppose we want to have a polynomial system that
;; is efficient for both sparse and dense polynomials.  One way to do
;; this is to allow both kinds of term-list representations in our
;; system.  The situation is analogous to the complex-number example
;; of section *Note 2-4::, where we allowed both rectangular and
;; polar representations.  To do this we must distinguish different
;; types of term lists and make the operations on term lists generic.
;; Redesign the polynomial system to implement this generalization.
;; This is a major effort, not a local change.
