;;; Exercise 2.71:

;; Suppose we have a Huffman tree for an alphabet of n symbols, and
;; that the relative frequencies of the symbols are 1, 2, 4, ...,
;; 2^(n-1). Sketch the tree for n=5; for n=10. In such a tree (for
;; general n) how may bits are required to encode the most frequent
;; symbol? the least frequent symbol?
