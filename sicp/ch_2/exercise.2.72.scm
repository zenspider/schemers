;;; Exercise 2.72:

;; Consider the encoding procedure that you designed in *Note Exercise
;; 2-68::. What is the order of growth in the number of steps needed
;; to encode a symbol? Be sure to include the number of steps needed
;; to search the symbol list at each node encountered. To answer this
;; question in general is difficult. Consider the special case where
;; the relative frequencies of the n symbols are as described in *Note
;; Exercise 2-71::, and give the order of growth (as a function of n)
;; of the number of steps needed to encode the most frequent and least
;; frequent symbols in the alphabet.
