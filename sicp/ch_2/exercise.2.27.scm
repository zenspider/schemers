;; Exercise 2.27.  

;; Modify your reverse procedure of exercise 2.18 to produce a deep-reverse procedure 
;; that takes a list as argument and returns as its value the list with its elements 
;; reversed and with all sublists deep-reversed as well. For example,
;;
;; (define x (list (list 1 2) (list 3 4)))
;;
;; x
;; ((1 2) (3 4))
;;
;; (reverse x)
;; ((3 4) (1 2))
;;
;; (deep-reverse x)
;; ((4 3) (2 1))
