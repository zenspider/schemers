;;; Exercise 3.21

;; Ben Bitdiddle decides to test the queue
;; implementation described above.  He types in the procedures to the
;; Lisp interpreter and proceeds to try them out:
;;
;;      (define q1 (make-queue))
;;
;;      (insert-queue! q1 'a)
;;      ((a) a)
;;
;;      (insert-queue! q1 'b)
;;      ((a b) b)
;;
;;      (delete-queue! q1)
;;      ((b) b)
;;
;;      (delete-queue! q1)
;;      (() b)
;;
;; "It's all wrong!" he complains.  "The interpreter's response shows
;; that the last item is inserted into the queue twice.  And when I
;; delete both items, the second `b' is still there, so the queue
;; isn't empty, even though it's supposed to be."  Eva Lu Ator
;; suggests that Ben has misunderstood what is happening.  "It's not
;; that the items are going into the queue twice," she explains.
;; "It's just that the standard Lisp printer doesn't know how to make
;; sense of the queue representation.  If you want to see the queue
;; printed correctly, you'll have to define your own print procedure
;; for queues." Explain what Eva Lu is talking about.  In particular,
;; show why Ben's examples produce the printed results that they do.
;; Define a procedure `print-queue' that takes a queue as input and
;; prints the sequence of items in the queue.
