;;; Exercise 4.71

;; Louis Reasoner wonders why the `simple-query' and
;; `disjoin' procedures (section *Note 4-4-4-2::) are implemented
;; using explicit `delay' operations, rather than being defined as
;; follows:
;;
;;      (define (simple-query query-pattern frame-stream)
;;        (stream-flatmap
;;         (lambda (frame)
;;           (stream-append (find-assertions query-pattern frame)
;;                          (apply-rules query-pattern frame)))
;;         frame-stream))
;;
;;      (define (disjoin disjuncts frame-stream)
;;        (if (empty-disjunction? disjuncts)
;;            the-empty-stream
;;            (interleave
;;             (qeval (first-disjunct disjuncts) frame-stream)
;;             (disjoin (rest-disjuncts disjuncts) frame-stream))))
;;
;; Can you give examples of queries where these simpler definitions
;; would lead to undesirable behavior?
