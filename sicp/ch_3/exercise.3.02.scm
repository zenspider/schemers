;;; Exercise 3.2

;; In software-testing applications, it is useful to
;; be able to count the number of times a given procedure is called
;; during the course of a computation.  Write a procedure
;; `make-monitored' that takes as input a procedure, `f', that itself
;; takes one input.  The result returned by `make-monitored' is a
;; third procedure, say `mf', that keeps track of the number of times
;; it has been called by maintaining an internal counter.  If the
;; input to `mf' is the special symbol `how-many-calls?', then `mf'
;; returns the value of the counter.  If the input is the special
;; symbol `reset-count', then `mf' resets the counter to zero.  For
;; any other input, `mf' returns the result of calling `f' on that
;; input and increments the counter.  For instance, we could make a
;; monitored version of the `sqrt' procedure:
;;
;;      (define s (make-monitored sqrt))
;;
;;      (s 100)
;;      10
;;
;;      (s 'how-many-calls?)
;;      1

;; (assert-equal x y)
(done)
