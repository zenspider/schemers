;;; Exercise 2.19:

;; Consider the change-counting program of section *Note 1-2-2::. It
;; would be nice to be able to easily change the currency used by the
;; program, so that we could compute the number of ways to change a
;; British pound, for example. As the program is written, the
;; knowledge of the currency is distributed partly into the procedure
;; `first-denomination' and partly into the procedure `count-change'
;; (which knows that there are five kinds of U.S. coins). It would be
;; nicer to be able to supply a list of coins to be used for making
;; change.
;; 
;; We want to rewrite the procedure `cc' so that its second argument
;; is a list of the values of the coins to use rather than an integer
;; specifying which coins to use. We could then have lists that
;; defined each kind of currency:
;; 
;;      (define us-coins (list 50 25 10 5 1))
;; 
;;      (define uk-coins (list 100 50 20 10 5 2 1 0.5))
;; 
;; We could then call `cc' as follows:
;; 
;;      (cc 100 us-coins)
;;      292
;; 
;; To do this will require changing the program `cc' somewhat. It will
;; still have the same form, but it will access its second argument
;; differently, as follows:
;; 
;;      (define (cc amount coin-values)
;;        (cond ((= amount 0) 1)
;;              ((or (< amount 0) (no-more? coin-values)) 0)
;;              (else
;;               (+ (cc amount
;;                      (except-first-denomination coin-values))
;;                  (cc (- amount
;;                         (first-denomination coin-values))
;;                      coin-values)))))
;; 
;; Define the procedures `first-denomination',
;; `except-first-denomination', and `no-more?' in terms of primitive
;; operations on list structures. Does the order of the list
;; `coin-values' affect the answer produced by `cc'? Why or why not?
