;;; Exercise 3.69

;; Write a procedure `triples' that takes three
;; infinite streams, S, T, and U, and produces the stream of triples
;; (S_i,T_j,U_k) such that i <= j <= k.  Use `triples' to generate
;; the stream of all Pythagorean triples of positive integers, i.e.,
;; the triples (i,j,k) such that i <= j and i^2 + j^2 = k^2.
