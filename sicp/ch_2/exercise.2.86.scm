;;; Exercise 2.86

;; Suppose we want to handle complex numbers whose
;; real parts, imaginary parts, magnitudes, and angles can be either
;; ordinary numbers, rational numbers, or other numbers we might wish
;; to add to the system.  Describe and implement the changes to the
;; system needed to accommodate this.  You will have to define
;; operations such as `sine' and `cosine' that are generic over
;; ordinary numbers and rational numbers.

;; (assert-equal x y)
