;;; Exercise 3.49

;; Give a scenario where the deadlock-avoidance
;; mechanism described above does not work.  (Hint: In the exchange
;; problem, each process knows in advance which accounts it will need
;; to get access to.  Consider a situation where a process must get
;; access to some shared resources before it can know which
;; additional shared resources it will require.)
