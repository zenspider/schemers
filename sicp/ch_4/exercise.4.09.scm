;;; Exercise 4.9

;; Many languages support a variety of iteration
;; constructs, such as `do', `for', `while', and `until'.  In Scheme,
;; iterative processes can be expressed in terms of ordinary
;; procedure calls, so special iteration constructs provide no
;; essential gain in computational power.  On the other hand, such
;; constructs are often convenient.  Design some iteration
;; constructs, give examples of their use, and show how to implement
;; them as derived expressions.
