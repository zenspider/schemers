;;; Exercise 1.31:

;;   a. The `sum' procedure is only the simplest of a vast number of
;;      similar abstractions that can be captured as higher-order
;;      procedures.(3) Write an analogous procedure called `product'
;;      that returns the product of the values of a function at points
;;      over a given range. Show how to define `factorial' in terms of
;;      `product'. Also use `product' to compute approximations to
;;      [pi] using the formula(4)
;; 
;;           pi   2 * 4 * 4 * 6 * 6 * 8 ...
;;           -- = -------------------------
;;            4   3 * 3 * 5 * 5 * 7 * 7 ...
;; 
;;   b. If your `product' procedure generates a recursive process,
;;      write one that generates an iterative process. If it generates
;;      an iterative process, write one that generates a recursive
;;      process.
