;; Exercise 2.28.  
;; Write a procedure fringe that takes as argument a tree (represented as a list) and 
;; returns a list whose elements are all the leaves of the tree arranged in left-to-right 
;; order. For example,
;;
;; (define x (list (list 1 2) (list 3 4)))
;; 
;; (fringe x)
;; (1 2 3 4)
;;
;; (fringe (list x x))
;; (1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4)
