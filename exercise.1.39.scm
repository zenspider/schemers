;;; Exercise 1.39:

;; A continued fraction representation of the tangent function was
;; published in 1770 by the German mathematician J.H. Lambert:
;; 
;;                    x
;;      tan x = ---------------
;;                      x^2
;;              1 - -----------
;;                        x^2
;;                  3 - -------
;;                      5 - ...
;; 
;; where x is in radians. Define a procedure `(tan-cf x k)' that
;; computes an approximation to the tangent function based on
;; Lambert's formula. `K' specifies the number of terms to compute, as
;; in *Note Exercise 1-37::.
