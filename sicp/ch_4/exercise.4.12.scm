;;; Exercise 4.12

;; The procedures `set-variable-value!',
;; `define-variable!', and `lookup-variable-value' can be expressed
;; in terms of more abstract procedures for traversing the
;; environment structure.  Define abstractions that capture the
;; common patterns and redefine the three procedures in terms of these
;; abstractions.
