;;; Exercise 1.38:

;; In 1737, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler published a memoir
;; `De Fractionibus Continuis', which included a continued fraction
;; expansion for e - 2, where e is the base of the natural logarithms.
;; In this fraction, the n_i are all 1, and the D_i are successively
;; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, .... Write a program that uses
;; your `cont-frac' procedure from *Note Exercise 1-37:: to
;; approximate e, based on Euler's expansion.
