;; Exercise 2.52

;; Make changes to the square limit of `wave' shown in *Note Figure
;; 2-9:: by working at each of the levels described above. In
;; particular:
;;
;;   a. Add some segments to the primitive `wave' painter of *Note
;;      Exercise 2-49:: (to add a smile, for example).
;;
;;   b. Change the pattern constructed by `corner-split' (for
;;      example, by using only one copy of the `up-split' and
;;      `right-split' images instead of two).
;;
;;   c. Modify the version of `square-limit' that uses
;;      `square-of-four' so as to assemble the corners in a different
;;      pattern.  (For example, you might make the big Mr. Rogers
;;      look outward from each corner of the square.)
