;;; Exercise 4.30

;; Cy D. Fect, a reformed C programmer, is worried
;; that some side effects may never take place, because the lazy
;; evaluator doesn't force the expressions in a sequence.  Since the
;; value of an expression in a sequence other than the last one is
;; not used (the expression is there only for its effect, such as
;; assigning to a variable or printing), there can be no subsequent
;; use of this value (e.g., as an argument to a primitive procedure)
;; that will cause it to be forced.  Cy thus thinks that when
;; evaluating sequences, we must force all expressions in the
;; sequence except the final one.  He proposes to modify
;; `eval-sequence' from section *Note 4-1-1:: to use `actual-value'
;; rather than `eval':
;;
;;      (define (eval-sequence exps env)
;;        (cond ((last-exp? exps) (eval (first-exp exps) env))
;;              (else (actual-value (first-exp exps) env)
;;                    (eval-sequence (rest-exps exps) env))))
;;
;;   a. Ben Bitdiddle thinks Cy is wrong.  He shows Cy the `for-each'
;;      procedure described in *Note Exercise 2-23::, which gives an
;;      important example of a sequence with side effects:
;;
;;           (define (for-each proc items)
;;             (if (null? items)
;;                 'done
;;                 (begin (proc (car items))
;;                        (for-each proc (cdr items)))))
;;
;;      He claims that the evaluator in the text (with the original
;;      `eval-sequence') handles this correctly:
;;
;;           ;;; L-Eval input:
;;           (for-each (lambda (x) (newline) (display x))
;;                     (list 57 321 88))
;;           57
;;           321
;;           88
;;           ;;; L-Eval value:
;;           done
;;
;;      Explain why Ben is right about the behavior of `for-each'.
;;
;;   b. Cy agrees that Ben is right about the `for-each' example, but
;;      says that that's not the kind of program he was thinking
;;      about when he proposed his change to `eval-sequence'.  He
;;      defines the following two procedures in the lazy evaluator:
;;
;;           (define (p1 x)
;;             (set! x (cons x '(2)))
;;             x)
;;
;;           (define (p2 x)
;;             (define (p e)
;;               e
;;               x)
;;             (p (set! x (cons x '(2)))))
;;
;;      What are the values of `(p1 1)' and `(p2 1)' with the original
;;      `eval-sequence'?  What would the values be with Cy's proposed
;;      change to `eval-sequence'?
;;
;;   c. Cy also points out that changing `eval-sequence' as he
;;      proposes does not affect the behavior of the example in part
;;      a.  Explain why this is true.
;;
;;   d. How do you think sequences ought to be treated in the lazy
;;      evaluator?  Do you like Cy's approach, the approach in the
;;      text, or some other approach?
