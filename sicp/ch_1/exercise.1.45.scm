;;; Exercise 1.45:

;; We saw in section *Note 1-3-3:: that attempting to compute square
;; roots by naively finding a fixed point of y |-> x/y does not
;; converge, and that this can be fixed by average damping. The same
;; method works for finding cube roots as fixed points of the
;; average-damped y |-> x/y^2. Unfortunately, the process does not
;; work for fourth roots--a single average damp is not enough to make
;; a fixed-point search for y |-> x/y^3 converge. On the other hand,
;; if we average damp twice (i.e., use the average damp of the average
;; damp of y |-> x/y^3) the fixed-point search does converge. Do some
;; experiments to determine how many average damps are required to
;; compute nth roots as a fixed-point search based upon repeated
;; average damping of y |-> x/y^(n-1). Use this to implement a simple
;; procedure for computing nth roots using `fixed-point',
;; `average-damp', and the `repeated' procedure of *Note Exercise
;; 1-43::. Assume that any arithmetic operations you need are
;; available as primitives.
