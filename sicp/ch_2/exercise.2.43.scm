;; Exercise 2.43

;; Louis Reasoner is having a terrible time doing *Note Exercise
;; 2-42::. His `queens' procedure seems to work, but it runs extremely
;; slowly. (Louis never does manage to wait long enough for it to
;; solve even the 6*6 case.) When Louis asks Eva Lu Ator for help, she
;; points out that he has interchanged the order of the nested
;; mappings in the `flatmap', writing it as
;;
;;      (flatmap
;;       (lambda (new-row)
;;         (map (lambda (rest-of-queens)
;;                (adjoin-position new-row k rest-of-queens))
;;              (queen-cols (- k 1))))
;;       (enumerate-interval 1 board-size))
;;
;; Explain why this interchange makes the program run slowly.
;; Estimate how long it will take Louis's program to solve the
;; eight-queens puzzle, assuming that the program in *Note Exercise
;; 2-42:: solves the puzzle in time T.
