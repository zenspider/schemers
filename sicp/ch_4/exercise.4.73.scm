;;; Exercise 4.73

;; Why does `flatten-stream' use `delay' explicitly?
;; What would be wrong with defining it as follows:
;;
;;      (define (flatten-stream stream)
;;        (if (stream-null? stream)
;;            the-empty-stream
;;            (interleave
;;             (stream-car stream)
;;             (flatten-stream (stream-cdr stream)))))
