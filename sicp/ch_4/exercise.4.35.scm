;;; Exercise 4.35

;; Write a procedure `an-integer-between' that
;; returns an integer between two given bounds.  This can be used to
;; implement a procedure that finds Pythagorean triples, i.e.,
;; triples of integers (i,j,k) between the given bounds such that i
;; <= j and i^2 + j^2 = k^2, as follows:
;;
;;      (define (a-pythagorean-triple-between low high)
;;        (let ((i (an-integer-between low high)))
;;          (let ((j (an-integer-between i high)))
;;            (let ((k (an-integer-between j high)))
;;              (require (= (+ (* i i) (* j j)) (* k k)))
;;              (list i j k)))))
