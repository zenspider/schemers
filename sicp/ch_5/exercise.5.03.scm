;;; Exercise 5.3

;; Design a machine to compute square roots using
;; Newton's method, as described in section *Note 1-1-7:::
;;
;;      (define (sqrt x)
;;        (define (good-enough? guess)
;;          (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
;;        (define (improve guess)
;;          (average guess (/ x guess)))
;;        (define (sqrt-iter guess)
;;          (if (good-enough? guess)
;;              guess
;;              (sqrt-iter (improve guess))))
;;        (sqrt-iter 1.0))
;;
;; Begin by assuming that `good-enough?' and `improve' operations are
;; available as primitives.  Then show how to expand these in terms
;; of arithmetic operations.  Describe each version of the `sqrt'
;; machine design by drawing a data-path diagram and writing a
;; controller definition in the register-machine language.
