;;; Exercise 1.15:

;; The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed by
;; making use of the approximation `sin' xapprox x if x is
;; sufficiently small, and the trigonometric identity
;;
;;                     x             x
;;      sin x = 3 sin --- - 4 sin^3 ---
;;                     3             3
;;
;; to reduce the size of the argument of `sin'. (For purposes of this
;; exercise an angle is considered "sufficiently small" if its
;; magnitude is not greater than 0.1 radians.) These ideas are
;; incorporated in the following procedures:

(define (cube x) (* x x x))

(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))

(define (sine angle)
  (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
      angle
      (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))

;;   a. How many times is the procedure `p' applied when `(sine
;;      12.15)' is evaluated?

(/ 12.15 3 3 3 3 3)                     ; 5 times

;;   b. What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as
;;      a function of a) used by the process generated by the `sine'
;;      procedure when `(sine a)' is evaluated?

;; Since everything is proportional to the x/3 part, space and steps
;; is O(log(n))
