;;; Exercise 3.23

;; A "deque" ("double-ended queue") is a sequence in
;; which items can be inserted and deleted at either the front or the
;; rear.  Operations on deques are the constructor `make-deque', the
;; predicate `empty-deque?', selectors `front-deque' and
;; `rear-deque', and mutators `front-insert-deque!',
;; `rear-insert-deque!', `front-delete-deque!', and
;; `rear-delete-deque!'.  Show how to represent deques using pairs,
;; and give implementations of the operations.(2)  All operations
;; should be accomplished in [theta](1) steps.
