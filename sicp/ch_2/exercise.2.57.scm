;;; Exercise 2.57:

;; Extend the differentiation program to handle sums and products of
;; arbitrary numbers of (two or more) terms. Then the last example
;; above could be expressed as
;;
;;      (deriv '(* x y (+ x 3)) 'x)
;;
;; Try to do this by changing only the representation for sums and
;; products, without changing the `deriv' procedure at all.  For
;; example, the `addend' of a sum would be the first term, and the
;; `augend' would be the sum of the rest of the terms.
