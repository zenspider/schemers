;;; Exercise 2.96

;; ;;   a. Implement the procedure `pseudoremainder-terms', which is
;;      just like `remainder-terms' except that it multiplies the
;;      dividend by the integerizing factor described above before
;;      calling `div-terms'.  Modify `gcd-terms' to use
;;      `pseudoremainder-terms', and verify that
;;      `greatest-common-divisor' now produces an answer with integer
;;      coefficients on the example in *Note Exercise 2-95::.
;;
;;   b. The GCD now has integer coefficients, but they are larger
;;      than those of P_1.  Modify `gcd-terms' so that it removes
;;      common factors from the coefficients of the answer by
;;      dividing all the coefficients by their (integer) greatest
;;      common divisor.
;;
;;
;; Thus, here is how to reduce a rational function to lowest terms:
;;
;;    * Compute the GCD of the numerator and denominator, using the
;;      version of `gcd-terms' from *Note Exercise 2-96::.
;;
;;    * When you obtain the GCD, multiply both numerator and
;;      denominator by the same integerizing factor before dividing
;;      through by the GCD, so that division by the GCD will not
;;      introduce any noninteger coefficients.  As the factor you can
;;      use the leading coefficient of the GCD raised to the power 1
;;      + O_1 - O_2, where O_2 is the order of the GCD and O_1 is the
;;      maximum of the orders of the numerator and denominator.  This
;;      will ensure that dividing the numerator and denominator by
;;      the GCD will not introduce any fractions.
;;
;;    * The result of this operation will be a numerator and
;;      denominator with integer coefficients.  The coefficients will
;;      normally be very large because of all of the integerizing
;;      factors, so the last step is to remove the redundant factors
;;      by computing the (integer) greatest common divisor of all the
;;      coefficients of the numerator and the denominator and
;;      dividing through by this factor.
