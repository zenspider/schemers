;;; Exercise 4.31

;; The approach taken in this section is somewhat
;; unpleasant, because it makes an incompatible change to Scheme.  It
;; might be nicer to implement lazy evaluation as an "upward-compatible
;; extension", that is, so that ordinary Scheme programs will work as
;; before.  We can do this by extending the syntax of procedure
;; declarations to let the user control whether or not arguments are
;; to be delayed.  While we're at it, we may as well also give the
;; user the choice between delaying with and without memoization.
;; For example, the definition
;;
;;      (define (f a (b lazy) c (d lazy-memo))
;;        ...)
;;
;; would define `f' to be a procedure of four arguments, where the
;; first and third arguments are evaluated when the procedure is
;; called, the second argument is delayed, and the fourth argument is
;; both delayed and memoized.  Thus, ordinary procedure definitions
;; will produce the same behavior as ordinary Scheme, while adding
;; the `lazy-memo' declaration to each parameter of every compound
;; procedure will produce the behavior of the lazy evaluator defined
;; in this section. Design and implement the changes required to
;; produce such an extension to Scheme.  You will have to implement
;; new syntax procedures to handle the new syntax for `define'.  You
;; must also arrange for `eval' or `apply' to determine when
;; arguments are to be delayed, and to force or delay arguments
;; accordingly, and you must arrange for forcing to memoize or not,
;; as appropriate.
