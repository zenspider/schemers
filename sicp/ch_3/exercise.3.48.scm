;;; Exercise 3.48

;; Explain in detail why the deadlock-avoidance
;; method described above, (i.e., the accounts are numbered, and each
;; process attempts to acquire the smaller-numbered account first)
;; avoids deadlock in the exchange problem.  Rewrite

;; need to modify `make-account' so that each account is created with
;; a number, which can be accessed by sending an appropriate message.)
