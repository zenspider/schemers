;;; Exercise 3.60

;; With power series represented as streams of
;; coefficients as in *Note Exercise 3-59::, adding series is
;; implemented by `add-streams'.  Complete the definition of the
;; following procedure for multiplying series:
;;
;;      (define (mul-series s1 s2)
;;        (cons-stream <??> (add-streams <??> <??>)))
;;
;; You can test your procedure by verifying that sin^2 x + cos^2 x =
;; 1, using the series from *Note Exercise 3-59::.

;; (assert-equal x y)
