;;; Exercise 4.60

;; By giving the query
;;
;;      (lives-near ?person (Hacker Alyssa P))
;;
;; Alyssa P. Hacker is able to find people who live near her, with
;; whom she can ride to work.  On the other hand, when she tries to
;; find all pairs of people who live near each other by querying
;;
;;      (lives-near ?person-1 ?person-2)
;;
;; she notices that each pair of people who live near each other is
;; listed twice; for example,
;;
;;      (lives-near (Hacker Alyssa P) (Fect Cy D))
;;      (lives-near (Fect Cy D) (Hacker Alyssa P))
;;
;; Why does this happen?  Is there a way to find a list of people who
;; live near each other, in which each pair appears only once?
;; Explain.
