;;; Exercise 5.26

;; Use the monitored stack to explore the
;; tail-recursive property of the evaluator (section *Note 5-4-2::).
;; Start the evaluator and define the iterative `factorial' procedure
;; from section *Note 1-2-1:::
;;
;;      (define (factorial n)
;;        (define (iter product counter)
;;          (if (> counter n)
;;              product
;;              (iter (* counter product)
;;                    (+ counter 1))))
;;        (iter 1 1))
;;
;; Run the procedure with some small values of n.  Record the maximum
;; stack depth and the number of pushes required to compute n! for
;; each of these values.
;;
;;   a. You will find that the maximum depth required to evaluate n!
;;      is independent of n.  What is that depth?
;;
;;   b. Determine from your data a formula in terms of n for the
;;      total number of push operations used in evaluating n! for any
;;      n >= 1.  Note that the number of operations used is a linear
;;      function of n and is thus determined by two constants.
