;;; Exercise 1.36:

;; Modify `fixed-point' so that it prints the sequence of
;; approximations it generates, using the `newline' and `display'
;; primitives shown in *Note Exercise 1-22::. Then find a solution to
;; x^x = 1000 by finding a fixed point of x |-> `log'(1000)/`log'(x).
;; (Use Scheme's primitive `log' procedure, which computes natural
;; logarithms.) Compare the number of steps this takes with and
;; without average damping. (Note that you cannot start `fixed-point'
;; with a guess of 1, as this would cause division by `log'(1) = 0.)
