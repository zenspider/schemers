;;; Exercise 4.47

;; Louis Reasoner suggests that, since a verb phrase
;; is either a verb or a verb phrase followed by a prepositional
;; phrase, it would be much more straightforward to define the
;; procedure `parse-verb-phrase' as follows (and similarly for noun
;; phrases):
;;
;;      (define (parse-verb-phrase)
;;        (amb (parse-word verbs)
;;             (list 'verb-phrase
;;                   (parse-verb-phrase)
;;                   (parse-prepositional-phrase))))
;;
;; Does this work?  Does the program's behavior change if we
;; interchange the order of expressions in the `amb'
