;;; Exercise 1.22:

;; Most Lisp implementations include a primitive called `runtime' that
;; returns an integer that specifies the amount of time the system has
;; been running (measured, for example, in microseconds). The
;; following `timed-prime-test' procedure, when called with an integer
;; n, prints n and checks to see if n is prime. If n is prime, the
;; procedure prints three asterisks followed by the amount of time
;; used in performing the test.

(define (prime? n) #f)

(define runtime current-inexact-milliseconds)

(define (timed-prime-test n)
  (newline)
  (display n)
  (start-prime-test n (runtime)))

(define (start-prime-test n start-time)
  (and (prime? n)
       (report-prime (- (runtime) start-time))))

(define (report-prime elapsed-time)
  (display " *** ")
  (display elapsed-time))

;; Using this procedure, write a procedure `search-for-primes' that
;; checks the primality of consecutive odd integers in a specified
;; range. Use your procedure to find the three smallest primes larger
;; than 1000; larger than 10,000; larger than 100,000; larger than
;; 1,000,000. Note the time needed to test each prime. Since the
;; testing algorithm has order of growth of [theta](_[sqrt]_(n)), you
;; should expect that testing for primes around 10,000 should take
;; about _[sqrt]_(10) times as long as testing for primes around 1000.
;; Do your timing data bear this out? How well do the data for 100,000
;; and 1,000,000 support the _[sqrt]_(n) prediction? Is your result
;; compatible with the notion that programs on your machine run in
;; time proportional to the number of steps required for the
;; computation?
