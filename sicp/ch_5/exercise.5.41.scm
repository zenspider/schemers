;;; Exercise 5.41

;; Write a procedure `find-variable' that takes as arguments a
;; variable and a compile-time environment and returns the lexical
;; address of the variable with respect to that environment. For
;; example, in the program fragment that is shown above, the
;; compile-time environment during the compilation of expression <E1>
;; is `((y z) (a b c d e) (x y))'. `Find-variable' should produce
;;
;;      (find-variable 'c '((y z) (a b c d e) (x y)))
;;      (1 2)
;;
;;      (find-variable 'x '((y z) (a b c d e) (x y)))
;;      (2 0)
;;
;;      (find-variable 'w '((y z) (a b c d e) (x y)))
;;      not-found
