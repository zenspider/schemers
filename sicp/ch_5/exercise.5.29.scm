;;; Exercise 5.29

;; Monitor the stack operations in the
;; tree-recursive Fibonacci computation:
;;
;;      (define (fib n)
;;        (if (< n 2)
;;            n
;;            (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))))
;;
;;   a. Give a formula in terms of n for the maximum depth of the
;;      stack required to compute _Fib_(n) for n >= 2.  Hint: In
;;      section *Note 1-2-2:: we argued that the space used by this
;;      process grows linearly with n.
;;
;;   b. Give a formula for the total number of pushes used to compute
;;      _Fib_(n) for n >= 2.  You should find that the number of
;;      pushes (which correlates well with the time used) grows
;;      exponentially with n.  Hint: Let S(n) be the number of pushes
;;      used in computing _Fib_(n).  You should be able to argue that
;;      there is a formula that expresses S(n) in terms of S(n - 1),
;;      S(n - 2), and some fixed "overhead" constant k that is
;;      independent of n.  Give the formula, and say what k is.  Then
;;      show that S(n) can be expressed as a _Fib_(n + 1) + b and
;;      give the values of a and b.
