;;; Exercise 5.27

;; For comparison with *Note Exercise 5-26::,
;; explore the behavior of the following procedure for computing
;; factorials recursively:
;;
;;      (define (factorial n)
;;        (if (= n 1)
;;            1
;;            (* (factorial (- n 1)) n)))
;;
;; By running this procedure with the monitored stack, determine, as
;; a function of n, the maximum depth of the stack and the total
;; number of pushes used in evaluating n! for n >= 1.  (Again, these
;; functions will be linear.)  Summarize your experiments by filling
;; in the following table with the appropriate expressions in terms
;; of n:
;;
;;                     Maximum depth       Number of pushes
;;
;;      Recursive
;;      factorial
;;
;;      Iterative
;;      factorial
;;
;; The maximum depth is a measure of the amount of space used by the
;; evaluator in carrying out the computation, and the number of
;; pushes correlates well with the time required.
