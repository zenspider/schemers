;;; Exercise 3.62

;; Use the results of *Note Exercise 3-60:: and
;; *Note Exercise 3-61:: to define a procedure `div-series' that
;; divides two power series.  `Div-series' should work for any two
;; series, provided that the denominator series begins with a nonzero
;; constant term.  (If the denominator has a zero constant term, then
;; `div-series' should signal an error.)  Show how to use
;; `div-series' together with the result of *Note Exercise 3-59:: to
;; generate the power series for tangent.
