;; Exercise 2.45

;; `Right-split' and `up-split' can be expressed as instances of a
;; general splitting operation. Define a procedure `split' with the
;; property that evaluating
;;
;;      (define right-split (split beside below))
;;      (define up-split (split below beside))
;;
;; produces procedures `right-split' and `up-split' with the same
;; behaviors as the ones already defined.
