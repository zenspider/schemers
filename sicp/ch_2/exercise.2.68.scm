;;; Exercise 2.68:

;; The `encode' procedure takes as arguments a message and a tree and
;; produces the list of bits that gives the encoded message.
;;
;;      (define (encode message tree)
;;        (if (null? message)
;;            '()
;;            (append (encode-symbol (car message) tree)
;;                    (encode (cdr message) tree))))
;;
;; `Encode-symbol' is a procedure, which you must write, that returns
;; the list of bits that encodes a given symbol according to a given
;; tree.  You should design `encode-symbol' so that it signals an
;; error if the symbol is not in the tree at all.  Test your
;; procedure by encoding the result you obtained in *Note Exercise
;; 2-67:: with the sample tree and seeing whether it is the same as
;; the original sample message.
