;;; Exercise 5.11

;; When we introduced `save' and `restore' in section *Note 5-1-4::,
;; we didn't specify what would happen if you tried to restore a
;; register that was not the last one saved, as in the sequence
;;
;;      (save y)
;;      (save x)
;;      (restore y)
;;
;; There are several reasonable possibilities for the meaning of
;; `restore':
;;
;;   a. `(restore y)' puts into `y' the last value saved on the stack,
;;      regardless of what register that value came from. This is the
;;      way our simulator behaves. Show how to take advantage of this
;;      behavior to eliminate one instruction from the Fibonacci
;;      machine of section *Note 5-1-4:: (*Note Figure 5-12::).
;;
;;   b. `(restore y)' puts into `y' the last value saved on the stack,
;;      but only if that value was saved from `y'; otherwise, it
;;      signals an error. Modify the simulator to behave this way. You
;;      will have to change `save' to put the register name on the
;;      stack along with the value.
;;
;;   c. `(restore y)' puts into `y' the last value saved from `y'
;;      regardless of what other registers were saved after `y' and
;;      not restored. Modify the simulator to behave this way. You
;;      will have to associate a separate stack with each register.
;;      You should make the `initialize-stack' operation initialize
;;      all the register stacks.
