;;; Exercise 4.4

;; Recall the definitions of the special forms `and'
;; and `or' from *Note Chapter 1:::
;;
;;    * `and': The expressions are evaluated from left to right.  If
;;      any expression evaluates to false, false is returned; any
;;      remaining expressions are not evaluated.  If all the
;;      expressions evaluate to true values, the value of the last
;;      expression is returned.  If there are no expressions then
;;      true is returned.
;;
;;    * `or': The expressions are evaluated from left to right.  If
;;      any expression evaluates to a true value, that value is
;;      returned; any remaining expressions are not evaluated.  If
;;      all expressions evaluate to false, or if there are no
;;      expressions, then false is returned.
;;
;;
;; Install `and' and `or' as new special forms for the evaluator by
;; defining appropriate syntax procedures and evaluation procedures
;; `eval-and' and `eval-or'.  Alternatively, show how to implement
;; `and' and `or' as derived expressions.
