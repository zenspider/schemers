;;; Exercise 2.91

;; A univariate polynomial can be divided by another
;; one to produce a polynomial quotient and a polynomial remainder.
;; For example,
;;
;;      x^5 - 1
;;      ------- = x^3 + x, remainder x - 1
;;      x^2 - 1
;;
;; Division can be performed via long division.  That is, divide the
;; highest-order term of the dividend by the highest-order term of
;; the divisor.  The result is the first term of the quotient.  Next,
;; multiply the result by the divisor, subtract that from the
;; dividend, and produce the rest of the answer by recursively
;; dividing the difference by the divisor.  Stop when the order of the
;; divisor exceeds the order of the dividend and declare the dividend
;; to be the remainder.  Also, if the dividend ever becomes zero,
;; return zero as both quotient and remainder.
;;
;; We can design a `div-poly' procedure on the model of `add-poly' and
;; `mul-poly'. The procedure checks to see if the two polys have the
;; same variable.  If so, `div-poly' strips off the variable and
;; passes the problem to `div-terms', which performs the division
;; operation on term lists. `Div-poly' finally reattaches the
;; variable to the result supplied by `div-terms'.  It is convenient
;; to design `div-terms' to compute both the quotient and the
;; remainder of a division.  `Div-terms' can take two term lists as
;; arguments and return a list of the quotient term list and the
;; remainder term list.
;;
;; Complete the following definition of `div-terms' by filling in the
;; missing expressions.  Use this to implement `div-poly', which
;; takes two polys as arguments and returns a list of the quotient
;; and remainder polys.
;;
;;      (define (div-terms L1 L2)
;;        (if (empty-termlist? L1)
;;            (list (the-empty-termlist) (the-empty-termlist))
;;            (let ((t1 (first-term L1))
;;                  (t2 (first-term L2)))
;;              (if (> (order t2) (order t1))
;;                  (list (the-empty-termlist) L1)
;;                  (let ((new-c (div (coeff t1) (coeff t2)))
;;                        (new-o (- (order t1) (order t2))))
;;                    (let ((rest-of-result
;;                           <COMPUTE REST OF RESULT RECURSIVELY>
;;                           ))
;;                      <FORM COMPLETE RESULT>
;;                      ))))))

;; (assert-equal x y)
