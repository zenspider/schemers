;;; Exercise 2.2:

;; Consider the problem of representing line segments in a plane. Each
;; segment is represented as a pair of points: a starting point and an
;; ending point. Define a constructor `make-segment' and selectors
;; `start-segment' and `end-segment' that define the representation of
;; segments in terms of points. Furthermore, a point can be
;; represented as a pair of numbers: the x coordinate and the y
;; coordinate. Accordingly, specify a constructor `make-point' and
;; selectors `x-point' and `y-point' that define this representation.
;; Finally, using your selectors and constructors, define a procedure
;; `midpoint-segment' that takes a line segment as argument and
;; returns its midpoint (the point whose coordinates are the average
;; of the coordinates of the endpoints). To try your procedures,
;; you'll need a way to print points:
;; 
;;      (define (print-point p)
;;        (newline)
;;        (display "(")
;;        (display (x-point p))
;;        (display ",")
;;        (display (y-point p))
;;        (display ")"))
;;
