;;; Exercise 2.83

;; Suppose you are designing a generic arithmetic
;; system for dealing with the tower of types shown in *Note Figure
;; 2-25::: integer, rational, real, complex.  For each type (except
;; complex), design a procedure that raises objects of that type one
;; level in the tower.  Show how to install a generic `raise'
;; operation that will work for each type (except complex).

;; (assert-equal x y)
