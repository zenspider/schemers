;;; Exercise 3.70

;; It would be nice to be able to generate streams
;; in which the pairs appear in some useful order, rather than in the
;; order that results from an _ad hoc_ interleaving process.  We can
;; use a technique similar to the `merge' procedure of *Note Exercise
;; 3-56::, if we define a way to say that one pair of integers is
;; "less than" another.  One way to do this is to define a "weighting
;; function" W(i,j) and stipulate that (i_1,j_1) is less than
;; (i_2,j_2) if W(i_1,j_1) < W(i_2,j_2).  Write a procedure
;; `merge-weighted' that is like `merge', except that
;; `merge-weighted' takes an additional argument `weight', which is a
;; procedure that computes the weight of a pair, and is used to
;; determine the order in which elements should appear in the
;; resulting merged stream.(5)  Using this, generalize `pairs' to a
;; procedure `weighted-pairs' that takes two streams, together with a
;; procedure that computes a weighting function, and generates the
;; stream of pairs, ordered according to weight.  Use your procedure
;; to generate
;;
;;   a. the stream of all pairs of positive integers (i,j) with i <= j
;;      ordered according to the sum i + j
;;
;;   b. the stream of all pairs of positive integers (i,j) with i <=
;;      j, where neither i nor j is divisible by 2, 3, or 5, and the
;;      pairs are ordered according to the sum 2 i + 3 j + 5 i j.
