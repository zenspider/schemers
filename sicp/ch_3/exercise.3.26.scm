;;; Exercise 3.26

;; To search a table as implemented above, one needs
;; to scan through the list of records.  This is basically the
;; unordered list representation of section *Note 2-3-3::.  For large
;; tables, it may be more efficient to structure the table in a
;; different manner.  Describe a table implementation where the (key,
;; value) records are organized using a binary tree, assuming that
;; keys can be ordered in some way (e.g., numerically or
;; alphabetically).  (Compare *Note Exercise 2-66:: of *Note Chapter
;; 2::.)
